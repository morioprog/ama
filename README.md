# Ama
A strong Puyo Puyo AI.

## Overview
Ama is an AI created to play Puyo Puyo Tsu 1P and PVP. This project aims to reach the playing strength of professional Puyo Puyo players.

## Features
- Efficient bitfield implementation inspired by [puyoai](https://github.com/puyoai/puyoai)
- Uses human-like forms as the default chain forms, such as GTR, Meri, etc. To disable human-like chains, set the `form` parameter in `config.json` to 0.
- Implements the ability to gaze the opponent's field:
  - Can harass the opponent at the right time.
  - Can return the attacks from the opponent.
- Implements high recovery mode that can build chain very fast.
- Decent chain building ablility.

## How to build
For now, this projects can only be compiled using `g++` that supports `c++ 20`. Make sure that your cpu support `sse4` and `pext`.
- Clone and `cd` to the repository.
- Run `make PEXT=true puyop` to build the puyop client.
- Get the binary in `bin`.

## Acknowledgement
- Thanks K. Ikeda, D. Tomizawa, S. Viennot and Y. Tanaka for their paper "Playing PuyoPuyo: Two search algorithms for constructing chain and tactical heuristics." Ama's search algorithm was heavily influenced by their work.
- Thanks [puyoai](https://github.com/puyoai/puyoai) for the fast implementation of bitfield and the inspiration for the evaluation function.
- Thanks [nlohmann](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) for the c++ json library.
